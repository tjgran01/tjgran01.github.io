              <h5>Humble Beginnings</h5>
              <hr class="my-4">
              <p>I was just taking a nap in my tree house when one day... ...</p>
              <br>
              <p>Okay, nah. I started out studying Philosophy and Neuroscience in my hometown of Syracuse, NY (Go Orange?).
              A town known for... well, its snow and bad attitude. I love it there. After completing my B.A. at Syracuse University I
              very quickly realized that the Philosophy factory had closed it's doors and moved out of the Unitied States! I needed a new plan so I
              I came out to Boulder, CO (Sko Buffs?) to do a Ph.D. in Computer Science. Which, if you look at graphs, tends to pay more than Philosophy.
              How am I planning on using all those big fancy engineering dollars you may ask? Well, to pay someone to build me a better website.
              Is there anything more to mention? I have to fill up this page with something, somehow. I'm sure of it. I suppose as my, shall we say,
              <i>very limited</i> web development skills improve (low bar, I know) I will add more to this page.</p>
              <hr class="my-4">
              <h5>A Hero's Call</h5>
              <hr class="my-4">
              <p>When all of a sudden some old guy in a cave told me 'it's dangerous to go alone, take this'? ... ...</p>
              <br>
              <p>Okay, nah, again. As you can see I am tragically unskilled when it comes to the art of talking about myself.
              That being said, you can still feel free to invite me to dinner parties. Guests tend to give me 3.213 out of 5 stars on yelp.
              Which, due to the selection bias of yelp reviews probably puts me at about a solid B / B+. I'm cool with that. If there's one
              thing to take away from this webpage it's that I'm striving for about a B / B+ in pretty much all of life's pursuits.</p>
              <p>One thing I don't strive for a B+ in is doing killer, super sick research! However, this is but my first year in the Ph.D.
              program so I do not have much to show at this time. Come back later and things will be <i>maybe </i> slightly more interesting.</p>

            <p>As a current Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/">The University of Colorado</a>
              I am interested in a toooonnnn of cool stuff. As for what research topics I am personally interested in exploring: well I can't just give
              that sort of information away all willy-nilly to strangers on the internet, can I?. You might steal my idea!
              Where would I be then, huh? Without a diseration, THAT'S WHERE. I see the ruse here, and I ain't falling for it
              (*cough* I don't have a diseration topic yet *cough*). Where was I? Oh, yes. My Research. I'll list it out below!</p>
